# Air-Quality-Prediction-Challenge
In this challenge we explore using satellite radar data from Sentinel 5P to predict air quality in regions in Kampala. The use of satellite data could expand air quality predictions to areas without air quality sensor devices.
The objective of this challenge is to predict air quality readings from AirQoâ€™s sensors using Sentinel 5P data.
